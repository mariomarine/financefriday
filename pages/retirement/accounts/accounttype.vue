				Roth vs Traditional
			</h2>
			<h3 class="subtitle">
				Choosing to pay taxes now or later
			</h3>
			<p>
				Depending on your situation, you may choose Roth or Traditional (or probably both).
			</p>
			<p>
				The simple explanation is:
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you expect to live on more money than you are making now, choose Roth
					</li>
					<li>
						If you expect to be spending less when you retire than you are now, choose Traditional.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Personally, I expect to be spending quite a bit more during retirement (think medical expenses, spoiling grandkids, traveling, etc...), so I max out my Roth Contributions first.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if you go the Roth route, be aware that you will still have tax deductions when you retire, and if you have no taxable income (aka traditional contributions), you will be giving up some free taxes. So contributing at least a little to a traditional retirement account is often more beneficial than choosing Roth only...
